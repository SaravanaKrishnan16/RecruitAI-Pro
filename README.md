## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Chrome (recommended) for best speech recognition support
- Microphone access in the browser
- AWS CLI (v2) configured with credentials and region
- Access to **Amazon Q Business API** (application ID) and your **MCP** endpoints/agent ID

### Clone & Install
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd mock-interview-assistant/frontend
npm install
```

### Start (development)
```bash
npm start
# then open http://localhost:3000
```

## 🔧 Configuration
Create a `.env` file in `frontend/` (example):

```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8001
REACT_APP_AWS_REGION=us-east-1

# Amazon Q
AMAZON_Q_APP_ID=47814a31-7cab-497d-808e-3baf3c9e2665

# MCP
MCP_AGENT_ID=your_mcp_agent_id
MCP_API_URL=https://your-mcp-endpoint.example.com

# Jooble API
JOOBLE_API_KEY=6d39d9c8-918d-479e-9eb0-065f6c9e09b3
```

**Note:** Keep secrets (API keys, tokens) out of the repo. Use Secrets Manager / Parameter Store for production.

## 📋 Amazon Q / Amazon Q CLI

### Purpose
**Amazon Q**: primary engine for role-specific and personalized question generation and (optionally) for transcription/post-processing.

**Amazon Q CLI**: handy for local/manual testing, CI integration, or fallback when SDK calls fail.

### Example: Generate a question via Amazon Q CLI
Ensure AWS CLI is configured and `qbusiness` subcommand is available in your environment.

```bash
# Single-line
aws qbusiness chat-sync --application-id "$AMAZON_Q_APP_ID" --user-message "Generate a Senior DevOps interview question"

# Multi-line (bash)
aws qbusiness chat-sync \
  --application-id "$AMAZON_Q_APP_ID" \
  --user-message "Generate 5 behavioral + 5 technical questions for Backend Developer"
```

### Knowledge Base training payload
`interview-knowledge-base.json` contains base64-encoded Q/A examples to seed or fine-tune **Amazon Q** question generation.

- Keep example entries concise and cover role, seniority, and context.

## 💼 Jooble API Integration

### Purpose
**Jooble API** provides real-time job listings from thousands of job boards worldwide, enhanced by **MCP** for intelligent matching.

### Features
- **Live Job Data** — Real-time job postings from 70+ countries
- **MCP Enhancement** — Search parameters optimized by **MCP** contextual analysis
- **Match Scoring** — **MCP** calculates 70-98% compatibility scores for each job
- **Smart Filtering** — Location, job type, company, and salary filters
- **Career Insights** — **MCP** generates market trends and skill gap analysis

### Example: Jooble API Call with MCP Enhancement
```javascript
// MCP enhances search parameters
const enhancedSearch = await enhanceSearchWithMCP(keywords, location, profile);

// Jooble API request
const params = {
  keywords: enhancedSearch.keywords, // MCP-enhanced keywords
  location: enhancedSearch.location
};

const response = await fetch('https://jooble.org/api/6d39d9c8-918d-479e-9eb0-065f6c9e09b3', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(params)
});
```

## 🧾 MCP (Model Context Protocol)

### Purpose
- **MCP Job Service** — job recommendations, candidate ↔ job matching, market insights, and real-time scoring.
- **MCP Scoring** — multi-dimensional scoring (Technical / Communication / Completeness), match-scoring algorithm, keyword/concept detection.
- **MCP Insights** — salary analysis, skill-gap reports, trend summaries.
- **Jooble Enhancement** — **MCP** processes **Jooble API** results for intelligent job matching.

### Example: MCP-enhanced Jooble job search
```bash
curl -X POST "$REACT_APP_API_URL/mcp/jobs" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "profile": {
      "domain": "Cloud & DevOps",
      "location": "Remote",
      "skills": ["AWS", "Kubernetes", "Docker"]
    }
  }'
```

### Example: Evaluate an answer via MCP scoring endpoint
```bash
curl -X POST "$REACT_APP_API_URL/mcp/evaluate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "questionId":"q-123",
    "answerText":"<transcribed answer here>",
    "context":{"role":"Backend Developer","keywords":["scalability","kubernetes"]}
  }'
```

## 📊 Scoring Flow (AI Processing)

### Interview Scoring Flow
1. Browser records audio → Web Speech API or local STT → raw transcript.
2. Transcript → **Amazon Q** (post-processing, contextualization) and/or direct pipeline.
3. Transcript + question metadata → **MCP** → scoring (Technical / Communication / Completeness).
4. **MCP** returns numeric scores, feedback text, and improvement suggestions (keywords, missed concepts).
5. UI displays scores, highlights, and next-question recommendations.

### Job Recommendation Flow
1. User profile + search parameters → **MCP** enhancement → optimized keywords.
2. Enhanced search → **Jooble API** → raw job listings.
3. **Jooble** results → **MCP** processing → match scoring (70-98% compatibility).
4. **MCP** generates market insights, salary analysis, and skill gap reports.
5. UI displays ranked jobs with match scores and career insights.

## 🖼️ Architecture (high-level)

```sql
User (Browser)
  ├─ Speech → Web Speech API / STT
  ├─ Transcript → Amazon Q (question generation / contextualization)
  ├─ Job Search → MCP Enhancement → Jooble API → Job Results
  └─ Transcript + Metadata → MCP (scoring, job-match, insights)
            ↳ MCP → Lambda / Job Service → Jooble API → Enhanced Results
```

**Fallback chain for question generation:**
```
AWS SDK → Amazon Q CLI → Local knowledge-base (interview-knowledge-base.json)
```

## 🛠️ Development & Scripts

```bash
# from frontend/
npm start          # dev server
npm run build      # production build
npm test           # run tests
```

### Adding/Editing Roles & Questions
1. Edit `frontend/src/data/roles.js` and `frontend/src/data/questions/*.json`
2. Add training / seed entries to `interview-knowledge-base.json` (base64-encoded if required by ingestion)
3. Update expected-answer patterns used by `mcpService.js` for improved matching

## 🚀 Deployment

### Local / Staging
1. Run backend **MCP** mock via `backend/` and point `REACT_APP_API_URL` to it.
2. Use the **Amazon Q CLI** for manual sanity checks before production.

### Production (example)
1. Deploy frontend to Netlify/Vercel or AWS Amplify.
2. **MCP services**: deploy as Lambda + API Gateway or managed container service.
3. **Amazon Q Business Application**: ensure production `AMAZON_Q_APP_ID` and IAM roles are configured.
